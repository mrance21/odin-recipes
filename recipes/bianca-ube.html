    <h3>What is ube?</h3>
    <p>If you’re not familiar with ube (pronunciation: oo-beh), it is a purple yam 
        native to the Philippines. Ube is sometimes confused with another 
        vegetable called taro, which has an earthier flavor and is used 
        in both savory + sweet dishes. On the other hand, ube is sweeter 
        and often described as having vanilla and nutty notes. It’s commonly 
        used in desserts, such as ice cream, cake, or jam. You could just use 
        ube extract in this recipe, but I used ube extract and rehydrated ube 
        powder. You could also use freshly mashed ube or halaya (if using the 
        latter, decrease the brown sugar by 1-2 tbsp). You can find these 
        ingredients in some Asian markets, especially Filipino ones, but if 
        all else fails, you can buy ube extract/halaya or powdered ube online!</p>
